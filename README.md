**Code Example (Excerpt):**

```c++
void loop() {
  // Read sensor data
  int distance = readUltrasonicSensor(); 
  int irSensorValue = analogRead(IR_SENSOR_PIN); 

  // Check for obstacles
  if (distance < OBSTACLE_THRESHOLD || irSensorValue > IR_THRESHOLD) {
    // Stop the robot
    stopRobot(); 
    // Implement obstacle avoidance logic (e.g., turn, reverse) 
    // ...
  } else {
    // Move forward at a controlled speed
    moveForward(SPEED); 
  }
}
```
